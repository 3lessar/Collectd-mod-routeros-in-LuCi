# Collectd-mod-routeros-in-LuCi

**Using collectd-mod-routeros in LuCi openwrt**

[Collectd-mod-routeros](https://openwrt.org/packages/pkgdata_owrt19_7/collectd-mod-routeros) is an openwrt package which based on "[Plugin routeros](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:RouterOS)" from [Collected](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd.conf.5.shtml#plugin_routeros). The routeros plugin connects to a device running RouterOS, the Linux-based operating system for routers by MikroTik. The plugin uses librouteros to connect and reads information about the interfaces and wireless connections of the device.
